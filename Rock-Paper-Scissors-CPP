    The purpose of this program is to provide the user with the utility to enjoy the classic, centuries old game of rock, paper, and scissors.
    With its state of the art computer decision system, this program is able to provide the user with a truly pseudorandom game while having the 
    added benefit of running on budget friendly hardware.
